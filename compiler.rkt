;; Stage 2:   IfArithTiny <-- Subsurface level, desugars IfArith
;;               |        (ifarith-tiny?)
;; Stage 3:     ANF       <-- Administrative Normal Form
;;               |        (functions have "simple" arguments)
;; Stage 4:  IR-Virtual <-- Assembly with virtual registers
;;               |        (linearized assembly w/ virtual registers)
;; Stage 5:     x86     <-- x86, with stack allocation
;;               |        (ir-x86?)
;; Stage 6:     NASM     <-- Assembly file
;; 
;; Once we have assembly code (in this case NASM assembly), we then
;; use a standard assembler / linker.

;; Stage 1: High-level language: IfArith
;;
;; Our high-level language will be IfArith--it has the obvious
;; semantics we have written several times before; the interpretation
;; is not the interesting part here. The only interesting thing to
;; note is that true is "anything but zero," and false is "exactly
;; zero."

;; Here are our primitive operators--notice that we don't include
;; =. Our notion of true will be "anything except for 0." Our notion
;; of false will be "exactly zero." We can get here by using
;; subtracts, etc...

;; IfArith is a tiny (sub-Turing) language we've seen several times
;; throughout the course. We will compile IfArith to x86, by way of
;; several steps. Our language is intentionally tiny: project 4 showed
;; us we can compile to the lambda calculus, now we show how to
;; compile a (much less expressive) language all the way down to
;; assembly code.

;; Stage 2: IfArith-Tiny
;; 
;; Now we'll observe that many of the forms in ifarith? can be written
;; in terms of other forms. This is like the desugaring we did in p4:
;; we just eliminate some forms by using existing forms. For example,
;; let* can be written as a sequence of single-binding lets (notice we
;; change let* to let). Similarly, forms for and/or/cond can be
;; compiled to usages of `if`.

;; simpler to compile fewer forms, so we take this shortcut; in
;; practice, many architectures (x86, etc.) do enable instructions
;; whose operands are a mix of registers, constants, and memory
;; addresses. A more advanced compiler would employ an instruction
;; selection phase to particularize these to a given ISA; we use a
;; naive strategy: stack allocate everything, shuffle into and out of
;; registers. It will work but it will not be as fast as if we used
;; registers more optimally.

;; Now we present a dirt-simple compiler from ir-virtual? to x86. The

;; stack-allocate all virtual registers. This approach will work,
;; provided we don't run out of stack space, and that we shuffle
;; results into and out of intermediary registers.
;; 
;; We should also note here that our approach is really only thinking
;; of a single function: variables are all global. In practice, these
;; will all just be local variables sitting on the stack in the
;; program's main function. It would be more complicated to handle a
;; language with functions, for many reasons, including a more
;; thoughtful handling of environments (closures, etc...).
